#  I Am Poor

## My Goal

This repo was forked off of the [London App Brewery](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/)'s starter project for working with basic view elements in iOS. My goal is simply to add a couple elements to the main app view that show that I'm part of 'the 99\%'.

## Notes during preparation

* It was pretty simple to find this and fork it off of Angela's initial submission. Let's see how an import into Xcode goes!

* No problem! Looks like all the app icons are in place and ready-to-go, as advertised. I'm gonna go ahead and get some objects into the main view.

* Just took a screenshot of the finished product. Going to post it on the Udemy course webpage here in a minute, commit and push the changes to my fork, and get started on the next section!

>This is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Developement Bootcamp, check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/). I (Brad) actually completed this as part of a Udemy course rather than an in-person bootcamp, but it's still a lot of fun! And I'll leave on the App Brewery's banners for their efforts in preparing the course and materials. :)
